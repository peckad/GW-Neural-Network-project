# GW-Neural-Network-project
All the code I wrote and used to create and train a neural network to classify events into gravitational wave signals or background noise. 

main_model.py is the main script for the project. All hyperparameters are set there, except for the structure of the network, set in create_model.py.

ALl other scripts are called in main_mdoel.py, either directly or via another script.
